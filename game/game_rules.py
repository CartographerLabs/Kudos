ONLINE INFLUENCE: Social Media Megagame
Players work to spread their group’s ideology and influence a social network. Each player secretly belongs to a group (e.g., conspiracy theorists) and aims to share engaging content that aligns with their group’s values.

Gameplay:
- Players take up to 3 actions per round: post, like, or reply.
- Points are earned through likes, replies, and interacting with group members. Misaligned posts lose points.
- Each round, the group with the most influence on the network gains bonus points.
- The player with the highest score in the most dominant group wins.

Scoring:
- +1 point for each like or reply to your posts.
- +1 point for liking posts by group members.
- +3 points if your group dominates the round.
- -1 point for misaligned posts.

The game lasts for a set number of rounds, with scores and influence assessed after each one.
